# SCILLA

SCILLA is a software for automated discovery of superconducting circuits.
Its goal is to facilitate hardware design for quantum information processing applications.
Starting from a desired target property for the circuit, it provides a closed-loop implementation of circuit design, property computation, and merit evaluation that searches the design space and identifies promising circuits.
The software and its scientific application are described in ref [1].
Implementation details and examples are provided in the supplementary information of the manuscript.

The script `main_benchmark.py` is provided as an example and benchmark of SCILLA.
It searches the space of 2-node superconducting circuits for a flux spectrum that matches the capacitatively shunted flux qubit.
The script is executed with the following command:
```python
python main_benchmark.py
```


### Requirements

This code has been tested with Python 3.6 on Unix platforms.
The required packages are listed in the `environment.yml` file.


### Disclaimer

_This repository is under construction._ We hope to add further details on the method, instructions, and more examples in the near future.
